The data included in the tidy_dataSet has the following Columns:
1. Subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
2. Activity_Label: Activity name recorded for the subject.
from 3 to 68: for each value of this column we are calculating the mean/average for the commulitive of grouped values Subject and Activity. The Columns are:
