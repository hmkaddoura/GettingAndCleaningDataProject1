## Introduction

This document was written to explain the script "run_analysis.R" that is submitted for Project 1 for the course Getting and Cleaning Data.

first of all, the script should be located in the unzipped folder where you should be able to see the 2 folders: test and train.

Second, run the script line by line in your R Studio.
Once done, you should find tidyDAtaSet.txt created in the same folder 

Thats all...
